\section{First Member}
%This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts.
%Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The best part about the FSE module for me was the sheer usefulness of the content. It's all well and good learning to code properly, access databases etc., but all of this knowledge amounts to a lot less than most people think if you don't know how to apply it in a working environment. In this era of software development you need to be a good communicator, a good teammate and an organised designer to work well in a team of developers. The FSE module was in all honesty not as interesting as the other modules this semester, but I wholeheartedly believe that it was and is the most useful by far.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

%To include an image, you will need to remove the comments from the code below, place an image in the main folder, and do not forget to put the name of the image instead of ImgName. 

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\caption{Selfie with Max}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImgName.jpg}
%\label{fig:selfie}
%\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Different styles of development including Scrum, XP and Kapkan.
	\item Life cycle of software from creation to indefinite maintenance.
\end{itemize}
